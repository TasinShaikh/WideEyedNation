                <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/1E3A8A/FFFFFF?text=London+Cityscape" alt="London cityscape at night" class="article-img mb-6 rounded-lg">
                <div class="prose prose-lg text-gray-800">
                    <p><strong>LONDON</strong> — Harry Styles, the charismatic lead singer of the band One Direction, was found dead early Sunday morning outside his hotel in central London, authorities confirmed. He was 31. Police are investigating the circumstances of his death, which appears to have been a suicide after Styles fell from his tenth-floor hotel room and landed in an alley below.</p>
                <p>Styles, born in Redditch, Worcestershire, England, rose to fame as the frontman of One Direction, a five-piece band known for their raw, emotive sound and loyal cult following. Formed over a decade ago, the band—comprising Styles, lead guitarist and vocalist Niall Horan, lead vocalist and songwriter Liam Payne, lead vocalist and songwriter Louis Tomlinson, and and Zayn Malik was a main vocalist. From underground venues to sold-out tours across Europe and North America. Their latest album, <em>Made in the A.M.</em>, was hailed as a critical success, with Styles’ introspective lyrics often cited as the band’s emotional core.</p>
                <p>Sources close to Styles suggest he had been struggling privately in recent weeks, particularly following news of the engagement of pop superstar Taylor Swift to an American american football player Travis Kelce. Styles and Swift, both in their 30s, had a high-profile relationship in their early twenties, during the nascent stages of their respective careers. Though their romance ended amicably years ago, those close to Styles noted that he had been deeply affected by Swift’s engagement announcement, which dominated entertainment headlines last week.</p>
                <p>“Harry was always the quiet one offstage, but he carried so much,” said a friend who requested anonymity. “He never stopped caring about Taylor, even after all these years. It weighed on him.”</p>
                <p>On Saturday evening, Styles performed with One Direction at a London venue, where bandmates reportedly noticed his subdued demeanor during soundcheck. “He said he was just tired,” drummer Liam Payne shared in a statement released by the band’s management. “We had no idea how much he was hurting. Harry was our brother, our voice, our heart. We’re shattered.”</p>
                <p>Authorities responded to a call at approximately 2:30 AM Sunday after hotel staff discovered Styles’ body in an alley behind the building, among refuse bins. A preliminary investigation suggests he fell from his room’s window. The Metropolitan Police have not released further details, citing respect for the family’s privacy.</p>
                <p>The music community has been quick to mourn Styles’ loss. “Harry’s voice was a raw, beautiful thing—a reminder of what it means to feel deeply,” tweeted indie artist Sarah Vale. Fans have gathered outside the hotel, leaving flowers, candles, and handwritten notes with lyrics from One Direction’ songs.</p>
                <p>Styles’ death has reignited conversations about mental health in the music industry. In a statement, the band urged fans to seek support if struggling, sharing resources including the Samaritans hotline (116 123 in the UK). “We wish we could’ve seen his pain,” the statement read. “Please, if you’re hurting, reach out.”</p>
                <p>One Direction has canceled upcoming tour dates. No official statement has been made regarding the band’s future. Styles is survived by his parents and an older brother. Funeral arrangements have not been announced.</p>
                <p><em>If you or someone you know is struggling with mental health, please contact a local crisis hotline or support service.</em></p>
