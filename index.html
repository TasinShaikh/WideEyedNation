        <h3>LIFE GOES ON... and that's the problem</h3>
        <p>
            Congratulations. You’ve somehow managed to wake up again today. How long will this miracle of mediocrity last? Life goes on, and so does the perpetual, joyless march toward the inevitable.
            It's like a train ride—except, there’s no scenic view, the food is cold, and the train never stops. Ever.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember that dream you had as a child? Of being something, achieving something? Well, that’s cute. Real cute. But it's time to face reality. You're just one in 8 billion, and the only real guarantee is that the ride will end... eventually.
        </p>
        <p>
            So why fight it? Just sit back, relax, and let the crushing weight of existence run its course. Because—spoiler alert—whether you like it or not, it’s happening. You're welcome.

        <h3>SAVE WATER, SAVE EARTH... Get Extinct Today!</h3>
        <p>
            The Earth has been through a lot. It survived meteors, volcanoes, and now… you. But don’t worry, you’re doing a great job destroying it faster than any natural disaster ever could. Cheers!
        </p>
        <p>
            You see, the less you consume, the more the Earth "recovers." Isn’t that adorable? Except, let’s be honest—no one’s going to stop. You’re thirsty, right? Sure you are. So drink that extra gallon of water. Go ahead, turn on the tap and let it run, endlessly, while you brush your teeth. We know you will.
        </p>
        <p>
            The best way to save Earth? Simple. Just… stop existing. Problem solved. But let’s be real. You won't. We’re doomed, and that’s okay. Because extinction is just nature’s way of saying, “I’ve had enough of your nonsense.” So why not speed up the process? You know, for the good of the planet.
